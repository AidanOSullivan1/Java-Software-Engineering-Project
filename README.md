# Java-Software-Engineering-Project
Project involved the creation of a fully function Catan Junior boardgame.
To experience the full potential of the game, please download the ANSI Escape plug-in from the Eclipse marketplace. This will vastly improve its usability as a colored lair and ship may be associated with a specific player.
Follow the instructions outlined in the terminal that will guide each player through all possible options during their turn.
Please select valid coordinates when building pirate lairs and ships. These are clearly visible in the map.
